Frame - the skeleton that connects things together.

	Imagine a worker. He builds a frame. Prepares environment creating tools and
services and suspending (services) to some frame's 'nodes' so the are available
at any time in any place inside that frame.
	Because he is building frame inside the instance he scans on jobs,
creates them, prepares and runs them.
	Inside jobs tools/services are available to be used whether as wrappers provided
by AbstractJob or access directly (since they are services).
