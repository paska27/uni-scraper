Instances

1. Instance is a specific project, an instance of Uni Scraper

2. A name for instance could be prefixed with "unis-" as a convention

3. Instance consists of jobs. They are a building blocks. They have to 
inherit from AbstractJob.php in order to have all tools requested in config.json. 
Inside them instructions are available: 
- browse(url), 
- parse(page), 
- extract(nodes),
- spec(path_spec).
A specific job can have its own user-defined instructions.

4. config.json. Configuration file which holds to tweak the instance:
which tools, services from UNIS to use. How to use them. How to connect to storage and so on.
Can be overwritten on job level.

5. spec.json. Configuration file for jobs. Instance-level spec.json is
overwritten with job-level spec.json files. They hold configuration corresponding to job's main instructions:
- browse: urls to browse
- parse: paths to parse specific parts of the page. E.g. for html/xml pages 
these could be xpath's.
- extract: field => path maps. the path is abstract for any kind of extractor.

6. Run.php is a starting point.
