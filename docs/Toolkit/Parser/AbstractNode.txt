# AbstractNode.php:
#The result of parse is a set of nodes.
#Node is defined by:
# - its path in the tree
# - its family (ancestors, descendants, siblings)
# - its properties. E.g. for xml/html tags that would be: text and attributes.
#For json that would be only text
#Abstract Methods:
#---traversing tree
# * find($path, $direction, $level) - searches for nodes regarding direction
#on level(s) deep specified
# * descendants($path, $level = null) = find($path, DOWN, $level)
# * children($path) = descendants($path, 1)
# * ancestors($path, $level = null) = find($path, UP, $level)
# * parent($path) = ancestors($path, 1)
#---data handling
# * get($property) - returns contents from property
#
#NOTE: extractor works with nodes. And by default (if not specified in job.json)
#it extracts info from text property of the origin (progenitor) node
