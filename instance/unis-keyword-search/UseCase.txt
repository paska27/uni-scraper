I would like you to find sales leads for woman's clothing boutiques and shops 
in the US midwest. You would be searching for keywords on on various listing 
and review sites.  I can share the list of cities, the keywords and 
the source sites I am interested in searching in. 
The results should be put into a spreadsheet.

Would need to scrape the following:
Store Name
URL
Address
Phone Number
Store Hours (if available)
Contact Name (if available)
Phone number or email address 

Sites:
* us-fashion.com
paths: 
/shops/list
/best-boutiques/

* glamour-girls
paths:
/best-stuff/


Solution:
---
The list of sites is given along with particular pages/lists to visit. 
In those lists search by keywords have to be done. 
If search succeeded - fields above should be stored.

Technical:
---
* each site will be a job. 
And each job will have to be configured specifically (e.g.: browser, parse, extractor).
* each site will have definition of what is list: (e.g. <li class="boutique">[\s\S]*</li>)
* each site will have a vocabulary on how to extract those fields (e.g. "store\s*name", "boutique", etc...)
* a global configuration for those things will of course exist
* results for each job will be store in its corresponding excel file
* a global excel merge will be done for all jobs

Algorithm:
---
1. run each job (~site)
2. for each pages, areas, form searches specified parse shops using keywords
and store them in files
3. for each shop (~item) run extractor and scrap fields using vocabulary
4. store structured shops' info into excel
4. run global merge of jobs' excels
