We have some list of events.
Each event has the following 'fields':
- title
- start/end dates
- summary
- venue
- stars

Title is a link which needs to be followed.
It will lead to details and they have the 'fields':
- title
- start/end dates
- description
- picture
- performer
- venue
- organizer
- email
- website

Information ought to be stored in tables: 
'event':
	- title
	- description
	- venue
	- datestart
	- dateend
	- email
	- rating
	- image_hash
(Actual images stored via ftp on some other server).

#NOTE: details' fields take precedence (so e.g. if there is description on
details page use it first, if no - use summary from item's content. Or venue
for details should have more precise location then the one in item)

#NOTE2: things needs to be configurable:
- source db
- source ftp
- fields map (html -> db)
- fields precedence
- rating calculation (stars to rating db field).

#NOTE3: start/end dates need to be parsed from start-end date 'field'
(e.g.: "2013-09-01 - 2013-10-01" ==> start: 2013-09-01, end: 2013-10-01)
