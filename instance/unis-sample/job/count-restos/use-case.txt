Objectives:
- site for listing restaurants (e.g. Europe)
- list of targeted cities is given
- for each city get restaurants count and store them in json format

Note:
there is no direct link to 'view all restaurants'. instead on all restaurants
page groups of restaurants is given. so count for specific city will be
sum of counts for each of the groups of restaurants.


Algorithm:
1. get list of targeted cities (from file)
2. loop through cities
3. fore each city:
	3.1 get page
	3.2 get restaurant groups list
	3.3 loop through groups
		3.3.1 for each group visit 'all restaurants page'
		3.3.2 store count for 'this' group
	3.4 calculate total restaurants number for all groups
	3.5 save results for 'this' city
4. export results into json
