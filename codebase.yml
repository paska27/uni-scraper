# Code base structure:
# Frame - the skeleton that connects things together
# Toolkit - tools to perform actual job(s)
# Service - the idea here is to 'wrap' tools from Toolkit to be avaiable in multiple places (~singleton)
#		Hook - hooks to trigger in during the job. Probaly no need to be a standalone toolkit.

# Instances
# 1. Instance is a specific project, an instance of Uni Scraper
# 2. A name for instance could prefix with "unis-" as a convention
# 3. Instance consists of jobs. They are a building blocks. They have to 
#inherit from AbstractJob.php. Inside them instructions are available:
#browse(url), parse(page), extract(items), saveResults(). A specific job can have its own
#'user-defined' instructions.
# 4. unis.json. Configuration file which holds to tweak the instance:
#which services from UNIS to use. How to use them. How to connect to storage and so on.
# 5. spec.json. Configuration file for jobs. Instance-level spec.json is
#overwritten with job-level config.job files. They hold configuration as:
#paths to extract from, field maps, urls etc. Also cycles config (more advanced).
# 6. Run.php is a starting point.

#Parsing and extracting
#1. Parser returns collection NodeItem[]
#2. Extractor works only with collection NodeItem[]
